# Two-Dimensional-Array-Manipulation
Two dimensional array usage example. 

Reads a file and loads data into a 2D array. The 2D array is used to produce a summary report. 
The report contains:
* The highest value in the entire data set and how many times it occurs.
* The first row number with the greatest range, and the range itself. 
* The row and column of the highest prime number as well as the highest prime number.
* The total of the column positions of the first prime number in each row. 
* The number of numbers in the range of 20000 to 120000 that occur at least once. 
* The value that occurs the most frequently, and it's frequency.

The program times how long it takes to produce the report. The timer starts after the data is loaded into the 2D array, so the timer only times the procesing of the array and the printing of the output. 
The time to execute is around 92743 microseconds or 0.092743 seconds
